QuPath MATLAB Extension
=======================

The **QuPath MATLAB Extension** is designed to help use QuPath and MATLAB together for whole slide image analysis in two possible ways:

1. Launching QuPath from within MATLAB
2. Sending data and calling MATLAB functions from within QuPath

For more information, see the [QuPath wiki](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/wiki/Working-with-MATLAB).

> Note: This extension is currently rather... rough.  It aims to show some ways in which the technical challenges of combining QuPath and MATLAB can be overcome, however it would benefit from some cleaning up and a wider range of helper methods (on both sides).  Currently, its aim is more instructional than functional: it provides tips and examples for how to use the software applications together.
